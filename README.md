## Overview
This MATLAB script simulates heat transfer in an underground mound structure, depicting how heat flows through tunnels and pores. The simulation visualizes temperature changes over time, providing insight into the behavior of heat in such environments.

## Getting Started
Before running the simulation, ensure you have MATLAB installed on your system. To execute the code, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/thayerh/sustainable-termite-housing.git
   cd sustainable-termite-housing
2. Open MATLAB and navigate to the project folder.
3. Open the model.m script.
4. Run the script in MATLAB.

## Simulation Details
The simulation comprises several components:
- Mound Structure: The underground mound structure is represented on a grid, including tunnels, pores, and the surrounding soil.
- Heat Transfer: The script calculates heat transfer over time, considering air temperature, soil temperature, thermal properties of air, heat convection at the soil-air interface, and air flow rate.
- Time Loop: The main simulation loop computes temperature changes at different positions within the tunnel over time.

## Visualization
The simulation results are visualized using a heat map that represents temperature variations over time. The color scale ranges from cooler air (green) to hotter air (red). You can observe how heat propagates through the mound structure, revealing areas of high and low temperatures.
